## 🟢 Beginner

### 1. What Are LLMs?

**Question:** What is a Large Language Model? Explain transformers, tokens, context windows, and temperature at a high level. How do models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini differ?

### 2. Prompt Engineering

## **Question:** What is prompt engineering? Explain zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. What makes a good system prompt?

## 🟡 Intermediate

### 1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

**Question:** What is RAG and why does it exist? Explain the pipeline: document chunking → embedding → vector storage → retrieval → generation. When should you use RAG vs fine-tuning?

### 2. Working with LLM APIs

## **Question:** How do you integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini) into a production application? Explain streaming responses, function calling/tool use, and managing conversation history.

## 🔴 Advanced

### 1. Embeddings & Vector Databases

**Question:** What are embeddings? How do vector similarity search algorithms (cosine similarity, ANN) work? Compare Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, and pgvector for different use cases.

### 2. AI Agent Architecture

**Question:** What is an AI agent? Explain the ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting), tool use, memory systems, and planning. How do frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex help build agents?
